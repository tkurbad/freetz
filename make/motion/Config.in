		Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from
		one or more cameras and is able to detect if a significant
		part of the picture has changed. Or in other words, it
		can detect motion.

		The program is written in C and is made for the Linux
		operating system.

		Motion is a command line based tool. It has absolutely no
		graphical user interface. Everything is setup either via
		the command line or via a set of configuration files
		(simple ASCII files that can be edited by any ASCII editor).

		The output from motion can be:

			* jpg files
			* ppm format files
			* mpeg video sequences
